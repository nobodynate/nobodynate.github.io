# Heist
10.10.10.149

there is a webserver on port 80. We are able to login as guest. We see an issue by an enduser who has attached their Cisco iOS config.

There are a few passwords in this file:

secret
```
$1$pdQG$o8nrSzsGXeaduXrjlvKc91
```
rout3r password
```
0242114B0E143F015F5D1E161713
```
admin password
```
02375012182C1A1D751618034F36415408
```

We found an online crack tool: https://www.firewall.cx/cisco-technical-knowledgebase/cisco-routers/358-cisco-type7-password-crack.html

and are able to crack the second two passwords

secret
```
stealth1agent
```

rout3r
```
$uperP@ssword
```

admin
```
Q4)sJu\Y8qz*A3?d
```

We used `crackmapexec` to find a valid set of credentials:

```
crackmapexec smb 10.10.10.149 -u hazard -p stealth1agent
```

hazard has the same password as the secret from the config.

we used crackmapexec to RID Bruteforce a few other users.

Then added the users to users.txt and password spray again.

We found another set of credentials `Chase:Q4)sJu\Y8qz*A3?d`

This is where we turned to a writeup for some pointers:
1. Use procdump to dump firefox.
2. Copy the file down
3. Strings dump-file | grep login_password
4. Now we have the admin password.

```
admin@support.htb
```

```
4dD!5}x/re8]FBuZ
```

Then we use crackmapexec to password spray the newly found password against our list of users obtained from the RID bruteforce. 

```
crackmapexec smb 10.10.10.149 -u users -p '4dD!5}x/re8]FBuZ'
```

This is the admin password! And we can execute commands

then we spawn a shell using evil-winrm
