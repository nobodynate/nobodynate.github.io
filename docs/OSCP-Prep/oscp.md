## What is the OSCP?

A certificate for those interested in offensive security jobs. To become certified the student needs to pass an exam. The exam consits of hacking a handful of computers in a 24 hour period and then submitting a report within the next 24 hours.

### Study plan

I've been studying on and off for years, but recently started taking a more active approach. [The Ultimate OSCP Guide](https://johnjhacking.com/blog/the-oscp-preperation-guide-2020/) by John J. Hacking has been a good outline to prepare for the exam.    

In December 2021, I completed the PEN-200 course. The course covered basic command line as well as complex topics such as setting up pivots and buffer overflows.

Lately, I'm meeting with a study/accountability group weekly to set goals. As I practice techniques on [HackTheBox](www.hackthebox.com) I'll document my steps and post them here to share with family and friends.
