## Enumerate the attack surface

This box is pretty basic looking. It appears to be running `Ubuntu`.

Remote login
- SSH (might be useful if I find a private key or gain credentials.)
	
This box (`ns1`) appears to be an authoritive name server for the domain (`cronos.htb`).
- DNS: bind 9.10.3-P4
	- Zone xfer appears to have failed, maybe I need to be domain joined?
	
This box also has a webserver:	
- Webserver: Apache 2.4.18
	- `/index.html` Got a 200 status code for this homepage.
	- Scan reveals Apache may be default configuration - this hasn't been set up yet.

## Exploitation

Will be following [HackTricks DNS guide](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting/pentesting-dns)

Did a zone transfer!
![[Pasted image 20220204005320.png]]

I added cronos to `/etc/hosts` and am able to see other sites now.


![[Pasted image 20220204005738.png]]

Going to rescan and take another break.

Found some pages on the newly found site:

Some more public exploits
![[Pasted image 20220204013953.png]]

Added `admin.cronos.htb` to hosts.

![[Pasted image 20220204014240.png]]

Got in with some SQL injection

Getting shell
Using PentestMonkey's reverse php webshell.

Don't need this anymore, but I found it and thought it would be cool to include

Start listener, and execute!

## PrivEsc

Found a few options for privesc on `linux kernel 4.4.0-72`
This one ended up working [EDB-44298](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44298)

Compiled on kali
```bash
gcc 44298.c -o pwn
```

Copy exploit and make executable.
