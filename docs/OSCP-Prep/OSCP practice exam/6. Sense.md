Most of those pages were behind a login page. I could only access
- `changelog.txt` - which mentions a recent patch FAILED, only patches 2 of 3 vulnerabilities.
![[Pasted image 20220203173133.png]]

- `xmlrpc.php` - which shows some XML error (probably because I'm doing a get request and it's expecting a POST with some command.)
![[Pasted image 20220203175941.png]]
Following [HackTricks guide to xmlrpc](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting/pentesting-web/wordpress#xml-rpc) I was able to get a list of valid commands. This can be used to brute-force creds if needed.


Do a POST with this payload:
```xml
<methodCall>
<methodName>system.listMethods</methodName>
<params></params>
</methodCall>
```

While researching how to use pfsense's XMLRPC, I came across [this exploit](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/154587/pfSense-2.3.4-2.4.4-p3-Remote-Code-Injection.html). The exploit requires credentials, but **grants RCE**. More about this weakness at [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16701)

It looks like the exploit is using this XML payload to check the credential (only password I guess?).
```XML
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='iso-8859-1'?>"
<methodCall>
<methodName>pfsense.host_firmware_version</methodName>
<params>
<param><value><string>PASSWORD_HERE</string></value></param>
</params>
</methodCall>
```
So I will check this, and brute-force if possible.

![[Pasted image 20220203183754.png]]

Appears to be working! (Incorrect password)

![[Pasted image 20220203183855.png]]

Now for the brute-force....
Well, that was short lived. 75 requests worked, but now everything is timing out. In fact, it appears the whole webserver is down now. Wait....duh....my IP is probably deny-listed 

:'(

Reverting...Will have to do something different for the brute-force attack. I could try the name of the box as the password...

Also just noticed, lighttpd has some DOS vulnerability, apparently the requests are just going to quickly for it to handle. If I slow them down maybe my brute force will get past 80 requests :)



- `index.html` - which has a link to install Dragon Fly BSD
![[Pasted image 20220203180039.png]]


I crashed the damn thing again....
Moving to another box, may have to revert this when I come back - sort of jumped right in and skipped enumerating the attack surface, maybe take a step back when I come back to it.

After reverting, and scouring the internet, the above screenshot seems to be tied to v 2.1.5 of pfsense.

![[Pasted image 20220204084646.png]]]

After reviewing the exploits on here, I've come full circle. I'm back at the XMLRPC exploit, but I still need credentials. Maybe I can modify the python exploit to brute force as well.

Downloading [this exploit](https://dl.packetstormsecurity.net/1909-exploits/pfsense-remote-code-injection.txt)

Split the file: lines 1-90 in `info.txt` and 91+ in `pfsense-rce.py`

This still isn't working.....maybe I can bypass the session thing on longin page using burp. I found some notes about using Intruder to update dynamic session values during a brute force, this may be the ticket.

Using Burp Intruder, with the following positions set, username is always `admin`:

Then set up Grep - Extract in Options to get around the session management:

Now to set payloads:

Note: for payload 2, I've added `,` to the Payload Encoding char list. 
![[Pasted image 20220204105758.png]]

For the wordlist, I've decided to use `rockyou.txt` - this has stalled burp while it loads

Trying to run this is causing my CPU to spike pretty heavily
